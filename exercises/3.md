# Exercise 3

In this exercise, we will get a collection of our posts from the Firebase Firestore database.

The project has the Firebase connection already configured. You need to import the `firebase` object from the `firebase.js` file. In this file, we initialize an instance of Cloud Firestore.

To read data from `Firestore`:

First, we should use the `collection` method to get a reference for a specific collection.

```js
const collectionRef = firebase.collection("users");
```

And to get the entire collection, we use the `get()` method. This method returns a promise with the documents of the collection.

```js
await firebase.collection("users").get();
```

We can do additional queries, like order the documents by a specific field with `orderBy` or limit the number of documents received with `limit`.

```js
await firebase.collection("users").orderBy("name").limit(3).get();
```

After this, we can get the documents from the value resolved in the promise returned by `get()`.

The promise will resolve to a collection object. This object has a few methods, including a `forEach` to iterate the collection and get each document. To get each document data, we use the `data` method, but this method doesn't return the document's id, so we should add manually it calling the `id` method.

```js
const collection = await firebase
  .collection("users")
  .orderBy("name")
  .limit(3)
  .get();
const users = [];
collection.forEach((document) => users.push(document.data()));
```

After we have our list of users, we can save it inside a React state.
