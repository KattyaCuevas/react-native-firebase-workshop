# Exercise 1

In this exercise, we will render a simple _Hello World_ message on our device screen.

To do so, we need two components exposed by React Native.

- [View](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view)
- [Text](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text)

The `View` component is a basic container of our UI. This is used to wrap texts, images, videos, etc. Compared to web development, it's similar to a `<div />`.

The `Text` component is used to render a `Text` or nested texts inside a View. This is the only component capable of rendering text on the screen.

Here, we need to import them from React Native and render the View with the `Text` inside, and inside the `Text` our Hello World message.
